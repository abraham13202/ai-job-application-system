## Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Web Scraping
- Job sites may block scraping or require login
- LinkedIn heavily restricts scraping (consider using API)
- Be respectful with request frequency
- Some sites may require Selenium for dynamic content

### ü§ñ Auto-Fill
- **Always review** before submitting
- You are responsible for application accuracy
- Some sites have anti-bot measures
- Manual review ensures quality

### üîí Privacy
- Resume data is stored locally only
- No data is sent to external servers
- You control all submissions

### ‚úÖ Best Practices
1. Review all generated content before use
2. Customize cover letters further for important roles
3. Track follow-ups and responses
4. Update resume_data.json regularly
5. Backup your applications.json

## Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Search for jobs
python main.py
# Select option 1, enter "data scientist" and "Sydney"

# 2. Review scraped jobs
cat jobs.json

# 3. Apply to a job
python main.py
# Select option 2, provide job details

# 4. Check generated files
ls -la tailored_resume_*.txt
ls -la cover_letter_*.txt

# 5. View dashboard
python main.py
# Select option 3

# 6. Export for spreadsheet
python main.py
# Select option 4
```

## Troubleshooting

### ChromeDriver Issues
```bash
# Check Chrome version
google-chrome --version

# Install matching ChromeDriver version
brew install chromedriver
```

### Scraping Blocked
- Try with longer delays between requests
- Use VPN or different IP
- Consider using official APIs
- Selenium may work better for some sites

### Import Errors
```bash
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```
